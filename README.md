# postgresql-questions

Hi Erwin. Not sure how to contact you so I tried this. :)

I'm working on a project where I'm trying to do an inserts-only approach to records and updates, but it's resulting in some SQL queries that are over my head.  Your answers on stack exchange are fantastic and I'd love to get your feedback on how to best store / query the information that we're storing.

Here is an example of one of the questions I have, but it's only one of a few. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31510914/how-to-store-and-query-version-of-same-document-in-postgresql

Would you be interested in helping me out on this project? I would really appreciate it.
